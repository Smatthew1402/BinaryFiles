THIS CODE IS REALLY BAD
it ended up storing each 0 and 1 as its own set of bytes.
it also has no compatability with anything
it got turned in for the assignment, but I am NOT proud of this code
if i had time or energy, i would try to get it working as it should, but i have to move on to other assignemnts.
